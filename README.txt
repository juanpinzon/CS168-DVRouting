Challenges:

We had a difficult time trying to implement the bellman ford algorithm and we got stuck trying to implement the least cost path. We were also a little bit confused on how to implement poisoned reverse. This project made us cry.

Features:
Bellman ford
Poison Reverse

We didn't handle link weights or do incremental updates.
